            <li>Use active recall! </li>

            <li>See if you can teach a concept to your friends! If you are able to explain topics to your friends, you most likely know the content.</li>
            <li>Keep distractions in another room such as your phone.</li>
            <li>When working on a course, assignment, or just studying, remember to stay diligent. Do not forget to take breaks every thirty minutes.</li>
            <li>Try to study for each subject everyday for at least 30 mins. </li>
            <li>Go over notes every weekend.</li>

            <h2>Organization Tips</h2>
            <li>Use OneNote to keep all your notes together. You can access your notes on your laptop and your iPad which is super convenient for exam studying!</li>
            <li>Goodnotes is also really helpful if you're up to spending some money!</li>
            <li>Have a planner! Write down all your due dates, tests, and meetings in one place right when the school releases these dates. Google calendar is a wonderful way to keep track of all your responsibilities! Physical planners are also great.</li>
            <li>If you are using a notebook, use sticky notes, highlighters, different colour.</li>
            <li>Make your notes as pretty as you want, or in anyway that will make you want to study again.</li>

            <h2>Assignment Tips</h2>
            <li>Try to start the assignment when it is given and try to finish it 4-5 days before its due so you have time to check over anything. Make sure to double check your work!!</li>
            <li>Try to have a couple of people go over the assignment so you can be sure there are no to very little mistakes!!</li>
            <li>Work very hard on your assignments because they are “practice” for your future exams!</li>

            <h2>Note Taking Tips</h2>
            <li>Annotate slides while your professor speaks! Don't waste time copying down the notes.</li>
            <li>Take notes on your own time if you really like taking notes.</li>
            <li>Read and understand the material first. Then take notes from whatever you remember without looking back at the material.</li>

            <h2>How to be a better student overall</h2>
            <li>Maintain a good work-life balance! Ensure that you are spending time with your family, friends, hobbies, and more because it is just as important! </li>
            <li>Don't be afraid to ask for help! Remember, you are in school to learn! So, it's okay if you don't get the concept on your first try! </li>
            <li>DO NOT PULL ALL NIGHTER!!!!</li>
            <li>Sleep early and wake up early. This is up to personal preference, but remember you can train your body over time even though you are a night person. If you're going to stay up an extra three hours, you might as well go to bed on time and wake up three hours early instead.</li>
